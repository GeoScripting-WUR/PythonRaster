# Handling Raster data with Python

## Intro

Howdy. Good morning. Today we will be playing with Python packages for spatial raster analysis.
Python has some dedicated packages to handle rasters:

* [Rasterio](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) focuses on raster analysis
* [PyProj](https://github.com/jswhit/pyproj) for re-projecting
* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) is fundamental package for scientific computing, such as array calculations
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for plotting
* [GDAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDAL) is powerful library for reading, writing and warping raster datasets

Before Rasterio there was one Python option for accessing the many different kind of raster data files used in the GIS field: the Python bindings distributed with the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library [GDAL]. These bindings extend Python, but provide little abstraction for GDAL’s C API. This means that Python programs using them tend to read and run like C programs. For example, GDAL’s Python bindings require users to watch out for dangling C pointers, potential crashers of programs. This is bad: among other considerations Rasterio chose Python instead of C to avoid problems with pointers. Rasterio strives to use modern Python language features and idioms. Rasterio is about high performance, lower cognitive load, cleaner and more transparent code ([source](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html)).

## Dataset

The data set for the raster python session can be downloaded from:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/rsc4lzkd3t2adq5/ospy_data5.zip?dl=0

Data is also available from http://www.gis.usu.edu/~chrisg/python/2009/lectures/


## Reading, analysing, and writing raster data

See here for a full [reproducible Python outline](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/GeoScripting-WUR/PythonWeek/blob/gh-pages/Raster%20data%20handling.ipynb).

An interesting www to check out if something unexpected occurs:

### Via Python

```{r, engine = 'python', eval=FALSE}
# import modules
from osgeo import gdal
from osgeo.gdalconst import GA_ReadOnly, GDT_Float32
import numpy as np

# open file and print info about the file
# the ¨../¨ refers to the parent directory of my working directory
filename = 'data/ospy_data5/aster.img'
dataSource = gdal.Open(filename, GA_ReadOnly)

print "\nInformation about " + filename 
print "Driver: ", dataSource.GetDriver().ShortName,"/", \
      dataSource.GetDriver().LongName

```

# Assignment

For this scripting challenge I have downloaded a Landsat image with all bands process to surface reflectance (Level 1T). You can download it from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zb7nrla6fqi1mq4/LC81980242014260-SC20150123044700.tar.gz?dl=0). Unzip the file and you will see that it contains all the invidual bands. 

Now, write a well-structured and documented script where you define a function to derive the NDWI and derive it from the landsat image and reproject the image to Lat/Long WGS84 (`x.ImportFromEPSG(4326)`).

`NDWI = band 4 - band 5 / band 4 + band 5` ([more info about](http://nsidc.org/data/docs/daac/nsidc0332_smex03_srs_ndvi_ndwi_ok.gd.html) `NDWI`)

A clean and well structured script is critical here.

## Deadline

Upload your documented and well structured Python script to a GitLab repository.

## Landsat data

You can easily order landsat data via:

  * https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/
  
Once the have the Landsat ID you can order further processed data (e.g. resampled, or as geotif, etc.) via:

  * http://espa.cr.usgs.gov/index/
